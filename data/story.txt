Protein is an essential part of our diets, as it helps to build muscle, hormones and plays a role in our immune health. 

There are several ways to get protein into our diets, from both animal and plant-based foods, to protein supplements. 

But it's important to remember that protein sources are not all equal, nutrition experts say. 

"Pretty much anything that comes from an animal is going to be a great source of protein. But there are also plant sources as well," Anar Allidina, a registered dietitian based in Richmond Hill, Ont., told CBC's The Dose host Dr. Brian Goldman. 

Allidina emphasizes that most people don't need to take supplements, as they likely get enough protein in their daily diet.
